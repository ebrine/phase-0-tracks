# a method that iterates through items, deleting any that meet a condition
#### Delete_if method

sample_array = [3, 7, 8, 15, 20]
sample_hash = {
  "apple" => "fruit",
  "spinach" => "vegetable",
  "papaya" => "fruit",

sample_hash.delete_if {|fruit, type| type == "vegetable"}

puts "Array and Hash after the delete_if operation:"
puts sample_hash
p sample_array


#### Keep_if method

sample_array = [3, 7, 8, 15, 20]
sample_hash = {
  "apple" => "fruit",
  "spinach" => "vegetable",
  "papaya" => "fruit",

sample_hash.keep_if{|fruit, type| type == "vegetable"}

puts "Array and Hash after the keep_if operation:"
puts sample_hash
p sample_array


#### Select Method
# the difference between this and the keep_if method is that the select method
# creates a new array, meaning you have to assign to a new variable if you want to keep it

sample_array = [3, 7, 8, 15, 20]
sample_hash = {
  "apple" => "fruit",
  "spinach" => "vegetable",

puts sample_hash
p sample_array

new_sample_hash = sample_hash.select {|fruit, type| type == "fruit"}

puts "New Array and Hash after the select operation:"
puts new_sample_hash
p new_sample_array


#### Drop_while method
# drops elements up to but not including the first element for which the block returns nil or false
# returns an array containing the remaining elements
# (creates a new array)

sample_array = [3, 7, 8, 15, 20]

  "spinach" => "vegetable",
  "papaya" => "fruit",

puts sample_hash
p sample_array

new_sample_array_2 = sample_array.drop_while {|number| number < 9}
new_sample_hash_2 = sample_hash.drop_while {|fruit, type| fruit != "papaya"}
# for hash data structures, the drop_while method does not work perfectly:
# instead of returning a hash, it converts the data type into an array of arrays that represent the key,value pairs

puts "New Array and Hash after the drop_while operation:"
p new_sample_hash_2
p new_sample_array_2
