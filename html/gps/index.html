<!-- Semantic tags give meaning to the parts of your text, and can aid people with disabilities when they're accessing your page. I think tags like Header, Footer and Nav are some of the most meaningful, in addition to Main, because they all help designate what to pay attention to and how to contextualize the text.

I think the browser reads HTMl from top to bottom, and displays them in that order.

I learned that you can make snippets in Sublime, which are shortcuts to hlep you write pieces of code that you frequently write (such as the basic layout of the HTML page). If I come across other bits of code that I happen to be writing repeatedly, I may create another snippet.

The idea of charset was new to me so I'm going to look into that a little more with the help of some resources that my guide sent along.
