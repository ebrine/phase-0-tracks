# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way of keeping track of changes to a code base, including creating, working on and merging different versions of a repository. It's makes it much easier for multiple people to work on a coding project together and not step on each others toes, as well as to protect code that is already working from being messed up when someone tries to add a new feature or change anything else. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a new version of a repository, kind of like a copy that you can work on without affecting the master copy. You would use one to make changes or add to an existing repository, which you could then test and have checked by another programmer before integrating those changes or features back into the master copy.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in git. A good commit message explains succinctly but in detail what you changed or added to the file/repository.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two or more people make changes on branches and then try to merge them with the master, and they have both made changes to the same lines of code, or person has deleted a file that another was working on. Basically, two people try to save conflicting changes to the master repository.
