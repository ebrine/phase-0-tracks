#### Plan for tackling jQuery in two hours
* Find some resources that explain what jWuery is/ how to install and use it
* Set up on my comp if there are set-up steps
* Find and watch video tutorials on basic jQuery functionality
* Try following along and adding some jQuery to my last JS project
* Watch more videos on different functionality to get a sense of what jQuery allows you to do
* Find and bookmark cheatsheets/documentation/other good reference sources
* Keep playing around and experimenting in code!

##### Main reasons for my approach: I want to get a sense of what jQuery is for, how to install/set it up, what you can do with it and how to code it. I also know that I learn well through doing, so I'd like to focus on watching tutorial videos wherever possible and supplementing other questions I have with text resources, and practice coding along as I go.
