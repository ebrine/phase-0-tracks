#### Key Design Philosophies of Linux OS
* Small is beautiful
* Each program does one thing well
* prototype as soon as possible
* choose portability over efficiency
* Store data in flat text files
* use software leverage
* use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
* avoid captive user interfaces
* make every program a filter

#### What is a VPS? What are the advantages of using one?
* A virtual private server is a virtualized server that is partitioned from a single server. To the user, it is like using a dedicated server, but at a lower cost. Some of the benefits are control over the server (root access), and good performance and stability compared with shared hosting where other users' activities can impact the performance of your server.

####Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
* My understanding is that it's mostly for security reasons, both for keeping you from doing some irreparable harm to your OS, as well as to protect your computer from viruses or bugs in the programs you're using.
